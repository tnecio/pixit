    <h3>What is PiXiT?</h3>
    PiXiT is an online game inspired by a board game called
    <a href="https://www.libellud.com/dixit/?lang=en">Dixit</a>.
    In PiXiT instead of using painted cards with dream-like imagery, users play with artistic photographs
    (kindly provided by <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>).
    Please note that the authors of PiXiT are in no way affiliated with the authors of Dixit: Jean-Louis Roubira, Marie Cardouat, nor with their publisher ‚Äì Libellud.

        <li><b>üèÅ Starting the game.</b>

            the people you'd like to invite to the game.</b> You need at least 3 people to play,
            although the more the better. Once all the players have gathered and pressed "Start"

        </li>
        <li><b> üìú  Narrator.</b>
            At the beginning of the round, one of the players will automatically become a narrator.
            This is indicated by an orange background behind their name on the list of players.
            Narrator's job is to select one of their cards and write down a phrase
            ‚Äì a hint to the card's content. They can do this by clicking one of the cards to enlarge it,
            then by writing down their phrase in the input box below the image and hitting "Select".
        </li>
        <li><b>üé¥ Card selection.</b>
            Once the narrator has chosen their card, it will appear in the top right corner, face down.
            Each of the players must now select one of the cards to try fool others into thinking that
            their card is the one that the narrator associated with the phrase.
            <i>For example:</i> <i>Here be example with pictures</i>
        </li>
        <li><b>üó≥Ô∏è Voting.</b>
            Once all the players have sent their card to the table, voting begins. Each of the players,
            except the narrator, try to guess which of the cards on the table was selected by the narrator.
            You cannot vote on your own card. Voting ends when all the players have cast their vote.
        </li>
        <li><b>üíØ Points.</b>
            After voting, the points are distributed as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>If everyone guessed the narrator's card: 2 points for everyone except the narrator.
                    (Therefore, the narrator should not make their hint too obvious).</li>
                <li>Otherwise, everyone whose card got voted on gets 1 point per each vote;</li>
                <li>everyone who guessed the narrator's card gets an additional 1 point;</li>
                <li>and the narrator gets 3 points if anyone voted on their card.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
