    <h3>What is PiXiT?</h3>
    PiXiT is an online game inspired by a board game called
    <a href="https://www.libellud.com/dixit/?lang=en">Dixit</a>.
    In PiXiT instead of using painted cards with dream-like imagery, users play with artistic photographs
    (kindly provided by <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>).
    The authors of PiXiT are not affiliated with the authors of Dixit: Jean-Louis Roubira, Marie Cardouat, nor with its publisher ‚Äì Libellud.

        <!--<h3>Coming soon:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Room Owner can lock/unlock the room.</li>
            <li>Multiple different sets of pictures from different sources (selected when creating a game) ‚Äì not only Unsplash photographs</li>
            <li>In-game chat</li>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>üèÅ Starting the game.</b>
            You can create either private or public games. Private games don't show up on the PiXiT front page
            and only people who you share the game link with will be able to enter the game. Public games will be shown
            on the front page and anyone can enter them.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once you have created the game, a unique link will be generated. <b>Share it with all
            the people you'd like to invite to the game.</b> You need at least 3 people to play,
            although the more the better. Once all the players have gathered and pressed "Start"
            the first round of the game will begin.
        </li>
        <li><b>üëÆ Room Owner</b>
            The person which created the game room will be designated a "Room Owner". They can kick misbehaving people
            out<!--, as well as lock and unlock the room (i.e. allow/disallow new people to join)--> at any moment in the game.
            When the Room Owner leaves the game, this role passes onto the next person.

        <li><b> üìú  Narrator.</b>
            At the beginning of the round, one of the players will automatically become a narrator.
            This is indicated by an orange background behind their name on the list of players.
            Narrator's job is to select one of their cards and write down a phrase
            ‚Äì a hint to the card's content. They can do this by clicking one of the cards to enlarge it,
            then by writing down their phrase in the input box below the image and hitting "Select".
        </li>
        <li><b>üé¥ Card selection.</b>
            Once the narrator has chosen their card, it will appear in the top right corner, face down.
            Each of the players must now select one of the cards to try fool others into thinking that
            their card is the one that the narrator associated with the phrase.
            <i>For example:</i> <i>Here be example with pictures</i>
        </li>
        <li><b>üó≥Ô∏è Voting.</b>
            Once all the players have sent their card to the table, voting begins. Each of the players,
            except the narrator, try to guess which of the cards on the table was selected by the narrator.
            You cannot vote on your own card. Voting ends when all the players have cast their vote.
        </li>
        <li><b>üíØ Points.</b>
            After voting the points are distributed as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>If everyone guessed the narrator's card: 2 points for everyone except the narrator.
                    (Therefore, the narrator should not make their hint too obvious).</li>
                <li>If no one guessed the narrator's card: 2 points for everyone except the narrator.
                    (Therefore, the narrator should not make their hint too difficult).</li>
                <li>Otherwise, everyone whose card got voted on gets 1 point per each vote;</li>
                <li>everyone who guessed the narrator's card gets additional 3 points;</li>
                <li>and the narrator gets 3 points.</li>
            </ul>

            Game end when at least one player gathers <b>30</b> points. After that players can immediately start
            the game again.
